        <h2> What makes a superhero? </h2>
        <p> A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero,<b> you need a power
        that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b> , and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. </p>
        <p> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interes story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy , 
        it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero. </p>
